### ServiceSpec

 
Service spec describing GraphQL upstreams. This will usually be filled
automatically via function discovery (if the upstream supports introspection).
If your upstream service is a GraphQL service, use this service spec (an empty
spec is fine), to make sure that traffic to it is routed with

```yaml

```
